# Lewis and Vazquez-Grande (2018) r* Estimation

This code uses Bayesian methods to estimate the natural rate of interest (r*) using data through 2018-Q3.  This specification was introduced in [Lewis and Vazquez-Grande (2018)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jae.2671), which is included in the *Paper* folder for reference, along with an appendix which outlines the state space structure of the model.

## Executing the code
Cloning the repository and running the MATLAB script `estimateModel.m` will produce estimates of the unobserved series for r<sup>*</sup>, r<sup>*</sup><sub>LR</sub>, potential output (*y*<sup>P</sup>), *g* and *z*.
